# Awake Sleep - Acerola Jam 0

![Banner](banner_long_big.png)

A short game for Acerola Jam 0. 

You go around and kill enemies (chicken and sheep do not attack you). 

If you die, you'll fall asleep. Don't die in your sleep. 

Press [esc] to close the game.


Hope you at least somewhat like it :)

Was somewhat busy while making this, and will now have to work on a different project.

(Yes, I know some entities are just rectangles... and that the camera is wonky...)
